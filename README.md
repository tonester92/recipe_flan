# RecipeFlan

In this project, I built a Ruby gem that provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) to an external data source. My project is based off of my favorite dessert, Flan. I chose two common Flan recipes from the Food Network and the All Recipes. You get to decide based on the data which one you think is best. Thank you for checking out my first gem!   

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'recipe_flan'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install recipe_flan

## Usage
Have you ever wanted to know the ingrendients, directions, and time it takes for a recipe? 
Follow the directions then in the program, "Enter the number for the recipe you want either 1 or 2 or type exit:"
  If you type 1: You will get the Food Network Flan recipe with all of its stats.
  If you type 2: You will get the All Recipes Flan recipe with all of its stats.
  If you have not decided: "Not sure which one is the best? Type one or two again. Or picked your favorite already? Type exit."
  If you decided the one recipe you want, type exit: "Goodbye, Which One Is Better for You?"
In the end you get to decide. 


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
